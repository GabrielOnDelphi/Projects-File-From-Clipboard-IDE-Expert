# Projects-File-From-Clipboard-IDE-Expert
This IDE wizzard detects when a PAS file (full or partial path) appears into the clipboard.  
Is the file is found in a certain folder (provided by the user via an INI file) it opens that file in the IDE.  
This is usefull when you work with GitHub, GitLab and other similar repositories and you have to open lots of files (for example, during a merge). Same for SonarCube.
